<h1>My Trip to Rome</h1>
<h2> The Pantheon </h2>

  <p>The pantheon was a place of religious worship. It was located in Rome and built during 128CE.</p><br>
  <p>When I first went into the pantheon I was amazed by not only the decorations, but the sheer size of the interior. It was so big I thought the entire city could fit inside! The shapes on the floor all the way to the decor on the ceiling. It's like everything was planned out perfectly.</p>

<h2>Colosseum</h2>

                  <p>The roman colosseum, built in 70 CE, was used for slave fighting. Owners would send there slaves in and watch them go up agaisnt another slave for entertainment.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>Just like the pantheon, the colosseum was huge. It was detailed, but its use was unusual to say the least. The slave fighting was grusome, but the people around me enjoyed it so I guess I am the odd one out. </p>
<h2>Circus Maximus</h2>

               <p>The circus maximus was a source of free entertainment. People would ride on chariots and horses would pull them as a race.</p>
               <br>
              <p>Seeing all the people there made the experience even better. There was a bit of violence, but overall not that bad. I can see why people enjoy it. Great experience.<p>
