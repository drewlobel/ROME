  <p>The pantheon was a place of religious worship. It was located in Rome and built during 128CE.</p><br>
  <p>When I first went into the pantheon I was amazed by not only the decorations, but the sheer size of the interior. It was so big I thought the entire city could fit inside! The shapes on the floor all the way to the decor on the ceiling. It's like everything was planned out perfectly.</p>
